### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps.
 1. Convert images to grayscale .

 2.  Apply Canny edge detection on the output .

 3.  Identify region of interest . 
  - Left Side .

  - Right Side .

 4. Apply hough transform on the region of interest .

 5. Identify the line markings and merge line markings and the original image .

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by getting the top and bottom coordinates of the end points of a line segment from huff transform. Then using these coordinates to draw lines for these coordinates

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline

We can have a lot of load on the system with image processing per frame
We are using very restrictive region of interest, which might vary with various road conditions

### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

A variable region of interest, which can be more flexible in order to identify regions
